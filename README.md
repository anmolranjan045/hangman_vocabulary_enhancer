# hangman_vocabulary_enhancer
1. Problem Definition: The importance of vocabulary in learning English cannot be overstated. Given the importance of vocabulary in learning a foreign language, mastery of this aspect should be assured and developed. Unfortunately, vocabulary becomes a major problem for the students in learning English as a secondary language. Students will have difficulties if they have limited vocabulary. Besides that, vocabulary is important to learn because to master English skills, we must have adequate numbers of vocabulary itself. To master vocabulary, people must first comprehend the meaning of a word, and then they must be able to appropriately speak and write that term, as well as use it in context. The use of games changes the boring class activity into an interesting one. The students’ interest to study a lesson would be higher through the use of games. Therefore, this might be another new alternative way of teaching. Games enhance the students’ motivation, interest, and concentration to study.


2. Objectives: The objective of the Hangman game is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The player is given a limited number of chances to guess the word, represented by a series of dashes or underscores, with each dash or underscore representing a letter in the word. The main objectives we are focusing on here are:
      1.	Improve vocabulary: The game requires the player to guess words, which helps to build and enhance their vocabulary.
      2.	Enhance spelling skills: The game requires the player to guess letters that are part of a hidden word, which helps to improve their spelling skills.
      3.	Promote critical thinking: The game requires the player to use critical thinking skills to determine which letters to guess next based on the letters that have been guessed and the length and nature of the hidden word.
      4.	Provide a fun way to learn: The Hangman game is a fun and engaging way to learn new words and improve spelling skills, making it an enjoyable educational experience.
      5.	Encourage persistence: The game requires the player to keep trying to guess the word, even if they have made incorrect guesses in the past. This promotes persistence and
      Resilience.
      6.	Improve memory: The game requires the player to remember which letters they have guessed previously, and which letters have not been guessed. This helps to improve their memory and recall skills.
      7.	Develop strategy: The player can use different strategies to guess the word, such as guessing the most commonly used letters or guessing letters based on the word's context. This helps to develop strategic thinking skills.


3. Scope: Our system's purpose is to enable our society, anyone with access to the internet and knowledge of English, to learn about simplified scientific information in an entertaining way while ensuring the scientific evidence's authenticity. The system allows the user who has access to the internet and wants to learn English vocabulary and spelling in an entertaining way.

4.Product Features: Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions. The Hangman Game contributes to the strengthening of vocabulary knowledge and the enhancement of vocabulary type scenarios. In this system, there are two modes: “Kid Mode” and “Pro Mode”. In kid mode, the word difficulty increases as the level increases. If the whole person is hanged then the user will lose the game and over again. But in “Pro Mode”, the user has to complete the level within 60 seconds. Else the timer would run out and the user will lose the game. We are not only helping with increase in vocabulary of a person with words but also their meanings. At last of the game, the game report (summary) of game is provided for better improvement.

5.Time of Completeness: The time it takes to complete a hangman game can vary depending on several factors, such as the complexity of the game, the level of detail in the user interface, and the skill level of the developer. For a simple hangman game with basic functionality and a simple user interface, it could take a beginner developer a few days to a week to complete. However, for a more complex hangman game with advanced features that we would like to implement in our project such as more challenging words, separate databases for level of words depending on the likeliness of the occurrence of the letters in the words, and advanced graphics, it could take several weeks or even month to complete. Additionally, the time it takes to complete a hangman game can be affected by the development approach used. Since we are using an agile development approach, the game may be developed and released in iterations, with new features added over time, which could extend the development time.
In summary, the time it takes to complete a hangman game can vary significantly depending on the complexity of the game, the level of detail in the user interface, the skill level of the developer, and the development approach used.

6. Challenges: There are several challenges that may arise during the execution of a hangman game. Some of these challenges include:
      1.	Word selection: Choosing words that are suitable for the game can be challenging. The words should be challenging enough to keep the players interested, but not so difficult that they are impossible to guess.
      2.	User interface: Designing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface can be challenging. The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear instructions for the players.
      3.	Gameplay mechanics: The mechanics of the game should be well-designed to ensure that the game is challenging, but also fair. For example, the number of guesses allowed should be balanced, so that players have a chance to guess the word correctly, but not too many guesses that the game becomes too easy.
      4.	Code implementation: Implementing the game mechanics and user interface in code can be a challenging task, especially for beginners. The code should be well-structured and efficient to ensure that the game runs smoothly.
      5.	Testing: Testing the game thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly and is free of bugs is essential. This can be time-consuming and requires attention to detail.
      
      
Overall, developing a hangman game requires careful planning, attention to detail, and a good understanding of game design principles and coding concepts.
